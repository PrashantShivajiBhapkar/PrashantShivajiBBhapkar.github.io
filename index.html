                        This was indeed a very interesting project! Our machines <i>(computers)</i> don't understand the same data in different formats. They have specific acceptable formats. In this project, I implemented a deep learning model to solve a natural language processing problem - neural machine translation. The trained model was able to convert dates written in natural language (English) into one consistent, machine-readable format. For example, the model was able to convert dates written in English, say “25th Jan 17” into machine-readable format - "2017-01-25".

                        "Autonomous car driving" - this sounds so cool. But there are various complexities involved in this. One of the problems is the detection of objects. If your autonomous car is not able to detect objects, then it might run over those! This gives an idea of how much important object detection is. But no worries, thanks to deep learning models, we are able to develop algorithms to solve this problem. In this project, a convolutional neural network was developed in which a very powerful algorithm - YOLO algorithm was implemented to detect objects. Specifically, the target object to detect was "car".
