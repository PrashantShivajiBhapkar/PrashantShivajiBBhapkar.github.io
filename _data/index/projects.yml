#    My attempt to implement the famous Word2Vec presented by Mikolov et al. in 2013. It enables in representing words as entities(vectors) in an n-dimensional space. This is one of the greatest breakthroughs in NLP research. It enables us to do more efficient, accurate and advanced processing on natural languages. And yes, the picture above is that of Milkolov's... in his honor.

    I led my team in the development of an NLP (Natural Language Processing) system to facilitate Hindi-language-learning. We implemented various natural-language-processing techniques like tokenization, parts-of-speech tagging, stemming etc. We also designed and implemented a novel rule-based disambiguation algorithm to resolve ambiguities in a given sentence. The implementation was done in C#.Net.
